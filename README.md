-To operate the program, find the code from the "Project 3" folder, run it in a code interpreter (We used CLion), and enter a number 1-5 to select an option.

-To add a node, first enter the ID then, when prompted, enter the rest of the properties with no spaces, separated only by commas (ex: 1332,32313,C3213,sc231,frgh9764,etc). You may enter less than 23 properties, but do not enter more than 23.

-To delete or search for a node, just type the node's ID.

-To exit the program, type '5'.
